This means I will need to run the model for longer if I wish to forecast the equation for longer. Now, this is okay for such a simple equation and small, one-dimensional domain since it's going to compute fairly quickly, but when the arrays being calculated are larger and multi-dimensional, we either need to suffer by increasing our gridspacing or we may be forced to find better computation techniques or simply use more advanced hardware.

If the flow, or the *wind* is blowing eastward, the position $i-1$ is \"upwind\" while the position $i+1$ is \"downwind\". The case is opposite for $u<0$; $i-1$ is downwind while $i+1$ is upwind. If the finite differencing scheme has more points on the upwind side, it is referred to as an upwind biased scheme, or an upwind scheme for short.\n",

    "So reducing the gridspacing did not help. As mentioned before, the downwind scheme is unconditionally unstable, meaning that it will break no matter what we choose. So here's the point of the need for an upwind scheme. What if we had a flow that, rather than being constant, varied from positive values to negative values in $x$? We would need to be careful to never implement a backwind scheme over any gridpoint. This means we'd need select whether to perform backwards or forward differencing in space depending entirely on the value of $u$ at each grid point. For now, we're assuming constant flow, but we'll explore this more in the next section.\n",
