    "So now we have a wave moving as a result of the background flow rather than the wave's internal propagation itself. We used some for-loops to perform this update, but ideally we want to vectorize this. Let's try that instead. We'll vectorize the backwards difference used to calculate the zonal gradient of the wave for each time step, leaving us with just one loop for the forward differencing in time. We have to keep this one, because we do not have a pre-defined $n+1$ on which to vectorize the implementation since that's what we are solving for."
