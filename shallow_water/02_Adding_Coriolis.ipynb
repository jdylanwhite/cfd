    "# Shallow Water Equations - With Coriolis\n",

    "Our model before made a few assumptions (in addition to linearity): no rotation, no shear, and no friction. This gave a simplified version of the shallow water equations. Now, let's relax the irrotational assumption. That is, we will now assume we have a shallow water system sitting somewhere on the rotating Earth. We can of course consider rotations on other planets, but let's focus on our own for now. \n",
